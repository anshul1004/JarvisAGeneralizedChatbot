# JarvisAGeneralizedChatbot

This project aims to build a generative chatbot, which will generate appropriate responses to any text input by the user. It uses the concepts of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing for the response generation. For the implementation part, Google’s open-source Machine Learning library, TensorFlow is used. This project is based on a “Neural Conversation Model” and “Sequence-to-Sequence Models”. While Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are used to generate outputs based on previous inputs, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are used for storing those previous inputs. Facebook Messenger is used as the interface where the user types the input in the form of a chat message to our created Facebook Page and in turn, gets a response from the chatbot.

The chatbot provides results, which grammatically sound correct. It can hold the conversation along with appropriate responses to some user inputs based on the training provided. Reddit comments dataset is used for the initial training of the chatbot.
